# BikeStoresPortfolioProject
My second portfolio project where I can use SQL and Power Bi skills.

The project based on sample data of bike stores. 
The data relate to the years 2016-2018 and three states-California, New York and Texas.


# Project Purpose:
* Provide information about revenue per year, state and store.
* Showing the most attractive bike brands.
* Showing the most effective sales representatives and the most loyal clients.
* Providing information on the number of orders and the number of customers in each years.

## The tools I used:
* Microsoft SQL Server management studio to explore data
* Power Bi for visualization
