# BikeStoresPortfolioProject
My second portfolio project involves utilizing my SQL and Power BI skills.

The project is based on sample data from bike stores in California, New York, and Texas from the years 2016 to 2018.


# Project Purpose:
* To provide information on revenue per year, per state, and per store.
* To identify the most popular bike brands.
* To identify the most effective sales representatives and the most loyal clients.
* To provide information on the number of orders and customers for each year.

## The tools I used:
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to explore data
* Power Bi for visualization
